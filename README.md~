********** HOW TO RUN ************
build:   ant
executable:   bin/map <ways> <nodes> <index>
system tests:  ant system_test_student

Group Members:
	Miriam Ashton
	Quynh Tran
	Birol Senturk

Who did what:
	Birol - Autocomplete
	Miriam, Quynh - Path Finding package (a-star from Bacon)
	Quynh, Miriam - FileReader package (binary search from Bacon)
	Birol - GUI
	Miriam, Quynh, Birol - KDTree


********** DESIGN ***************
optimization: 
  - HASHMAPS -
    "nodeLatLongPointers"
        key: first 8 digits of node ID chunk, ex.  "4023.5788"
        maps these 8-digit "chunks" to two Longs, the beginning file pointer of 
        the chunk and the pointer to the end of it
        * makes it easy to search for a given node ID 

    "nodeLatPointers"
         key: first 4 digits of node ID chunk, ex. "4023"
         maps these 4-digit chunks to the file pointer of beginning of chunk


    "getNodePage"
    	called in pathfinding -- if path wants a node that starts with id 
    	"4023.5788" it returns that node but also all the nodes that have
    	the same 8 digit starting number

	"streetNodesOnScreen"
		maps chunks of street node data as nodes are being read from the file to be
		able to quickly retreive them later when GUI asks for a previously read 
		portion of the map data/

  - THREADS -
	"UpdateMapThread" 
		sends a map update request to backend.
		Allows UI to be responsive while map nodes are being updated.

	"RequestPathThread" 
		sends a path request to backend while GUI continues to run.

  -	BATCH I/O
	"ReadOneLine"
		reads 256 byte batches instead of a single character.

  -	A* SEARCH 
	"heuristic" 
		Uses euclidian distance between two nodes as the A* heuristic to make path finding more 
		efficient.

************* BUGS ***************

  -	PATH FINDING
		Sometimes pathfinding gets stuck if one of the nodes is part of a closed look (a building for example)
		
		Sometimes old path is not cleared when a new path request is created.

  -	GUI
		"Clear" button does not clear text boxes if autocorrect list is not empty. Clicking a second time always clears the 		text boxes.
